This is a small project I am doing that provides a web service, in order to learn more python, specifically web development and Flask

I run Gruss Betting Assistant to be able to interface with Betfair, get prices of the days horses, etc. Some python code deals with grabbing 
the data from betfair, and storing it. I use Flask and websockets in order to request and send data from an SQLite database to the web page.The web page allows you to enter a value, and will then display all horses for the day whose price
has moved more than the value you enter since the start of the day.
